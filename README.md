This is a project to help me to demonstrate the very basic of front-end web development. It requires me to use various HTML tags in combination with CSS to make a web page that is very similar to the google.com homepage. 

Various style uses include box-shadows, borders, flex-boxes, and more.

Various HTML features include div boxes, an upper navigation (NAV) bar, and a lower one.
